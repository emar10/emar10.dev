I've been using[^1] [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to power my personal
website for some time. But when building the website for my university's [ACM
Branch](https://umw-acm.org) earlier this year, I ran across
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a similar solution. Given that I knew I would be
handing the site off to others, the idea of not needing to wrestle with Ruby
and Jekyll's dependencies was quite attractive. I was hesitant to switch my
personal website, as I had put blood, sweat, and tears into my own custom
Jekyll theme. So life went on as usual.

Fast forward to today, where I've recently switched to a new laptop for work on
the go. I wipe most of my devices on a yearly basis, so I've mostly got the
process of spinning up a "new" box down to a science (perhaps the topic for
a future post). I didn't have cause to do anything with my website until a few
days ago, so I hadn't gotten my environment set up for that particular task.
I don't personally develop with Ruby, so once again I questioned the need to
have a full environment set up just to use a static site generator.

And so, I've decided to take a leap of faith and start fresh with Hugo.
Somewhere down the line I'll get around to rebuilding my own setup, but at the
time of writing I'm using Luiz de Pr√°'s excellent theme
[Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

So I hear I've been tagged to partake in a blogging question challenge started
over on [Bear Blog][1] by [Ava][2] (and later adapted for blogging in general
by [Kev Quirk][3]). I'd never heard of Bear before, but I like the vibe. It
reminds me a lot of the more pleasant parts of my earliest days on the
Internet. A lot of these questions open up discussion points that I wouldn't be
likely to bring up otherwise[^1], so I'm excited to give this a shot.

Thanks to friend and colleague [Brandon][4] for tagging me! I encourage readers
to check out his post and take a walk up/down the tag chain.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

Truth be told, I'm not sure I remember exactly why I started blogging in the
first place. I've followed a fair number of other blogs in my time, but I tend
to be more of a lurker on the Internet. I've run a personal website in some
form for close to ten years now, I think, but this iteration was the first to
include an actual blog.

Before I started blogging, my personal site mostly just existed as something to
host my resume on[^2],

    HTML!

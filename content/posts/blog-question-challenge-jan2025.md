So I hear I've been tagged to partake in a blogging question challenge started
over on [Bear Blog][1] by [Ava][2] (and later adapted for blogging in general
by [Kev Quirk][3]). I'd never heard of Bear before, but I like the vibe. It
reminds me a lot of the more pleasant parts of my earliest days on the
Internet. A lot of these questions open up discussion points that I wouldn't be
likely to bring up otherwise[^1], so I'm excited to give this a shot.

Thanks to friend and colleague [Brandon][4] for tagging me! I encourage readers
to check out his post and take a walk up/down the tag chain.

[^1]: Which is probably the point, to be fair.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

Truth be told, I'm not sure I remember exactly why I started blogging in the
first place. I've followed a fair number of other blogs in my time, but I tend
to be more of a lurker on the Internet. I've run a personal website in some
form for close to ten years now, I think, but this iteration was the first to
include an actual blog.

Before I started blogging, my personal site mostly just existed as something to
host my resume on.[^2] While some of that spirit remains despite me no longer
publicly displaying my resume, the blog is a space that is truly my own to
write what I please and hone my craft. This is the perfect place to
self-reflect on projects as I'm working on them. I can document little tricks
I've used to implement something that I'd certainly forget otherwise. It's
pretty much just for my own benefit at the end of the day, but if a post of
mine happens to be helpful to someone else, all the better.

[^2]: And to put in my resume. Look at me, I've got the know-how to deploy some
    HTML!

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

I currently use [Hugo][5], a Go-based static site generator. It has great
theming support, lets me use version control systems I'm already comfortable
with, and the build output is just static HTML that runs fast and is dead
simple to deploy.

At time of writing, this site is hosted on [Linode][6][^3]. It's not the
cheapest VPS around, but it's inexpensive and the feature set is good.

Another tool involved in my website is my tiny recipe manager, [Sous]. Recipes
are included as a Git submodule, then turned into Hugo pages during build. It's
slightly out of date, but I made a more detailed post on this topic
[here][7].

[^3]: Or *Akamai Connected Cloud* these days, I guess.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I'd previously used [Jekyll][8] for many of the same reasons that I currently
use Hugo. However, it requires a full Ruby environment to run, and I'm very
much not a Ruby developer. That said, I didn't really blog at the time.

## How do you write your posts?

From a tech stack perspective, I've been a fervent (neo)Vim user for somewhere
in the ballpark of a decade. Right now I'm using [LazyVim][9], an excellent
Neovim distribution that leverages the coolest of the cool new plugins on the
block. But Hugo just uses Markdown, and Markdown is generally nice to work
with, whatever the tool at play. I could boot up a DOS machine and use good ol'
`EDIT.COM` and I wouldn't have *that* bad of a time.

As for my writing process, that varies wildly. For some posts[^4], I just start
with a topic and put words to keyboard until I feel like there's enough. And
some posts don't need anything more than that. Recently though I've made more
of an effort to outline posts more.[^5]

[^4]: Mostly older ones.
[^5]: This one was easy, the outline was already done for me!

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

## What's your favorite post on your blog?

## Any future plans for your blog?

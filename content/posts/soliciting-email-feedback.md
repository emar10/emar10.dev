Hello! This is just a quick meta post to draw attention to a minor change around
here: _feedback links!_ In lieu of adding a commenting system, there should now
be a mailto link at the bottom of each post (including this one!) for any
readers who want to respond to my ramblings. Unless of course you are reading
this in a future where I've changed this approach. I get _some_ feedback on
posts already, but I'm interested to see how more explicitly offering changes
things.

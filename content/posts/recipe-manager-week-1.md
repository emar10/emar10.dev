Happy ~~Monday~~ Tuesday, and welcome to the first development update for my
recipe manager, tentatively named *Sous*. There are a few things to cover,
including the chosen development environment, the beginnings of the core
library, and a basic first client.

# Development Environment

To step a little out of my comfort zone, I've chosen to build Sous using Rust.
I would have far more experience with C/C++, C#, or Python, but Rust makes an
interesting value proposition[^1] and I've been meaning to give it a try for a
larger project for a while.

# Core Library

Currently the core of Sous consists of a single naive `Recipe` data structure:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Recipe {
    name: String,
    steps: Vec<String>,
    ingredients: Vec<String>,
}
```

This struct represents a recipe similarly to how one would using a standard
text editor or note application, containing only a name and two lists of
strings for the ingredients/method. This affords the user a decent amount of
flexibility in how to express recipes, but encodes very little information
readily available to the application.

The [`serde`](https://serde.rs/) and
[`serde_yaml`](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml) crates allow recipes to
be easily stored/loaded in YAML format, though a more maintainable solution
will likely be required as the library grows.[^2]

# Sous CLI

To demonstrate this early functionality I've created a basic first CLI for Sous
that can ingest a YAML-formatted recipe file and output a simple Markdown
representation either to standard output or a file. It makes use of the
excellent [`clap`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) crate to implement command
line arguments with a simple struct:

```rust
#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[command()]
struct Args {
    /// YAML-formatted recipe to convert
    #[arg()]
    file: PathBuf,

    /// Output file
    #[arg(short, long)]
    output: Option<PathBuf>,
}
```

As an example, `sous tenderloin.yml -o tenderloin.md` with this YAML:

```yaml
---

name: Pork Tenderloin
ingredients:
  - 1 tenderloin
  - 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
  - Salt
  - Pepper
  - Olive oil
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 400째F.
  - Pat tenderloin dry with a paper towel.
  - Cover tenderloin with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
  - Coat the bottom of an oven-safe pan with olive oil and put over medium-high heat until shimmering.
  - Sear the tenderloin, turning occasionally, for about 8 minutes or until well browned.
  - Remove pan from heat and place in oven for 20 minutes or until an internal temperature of 145째F is reached.
  - Remove from oven and loosely tent with foil, allowing to rest for at least 5 minutes before cutting and serving.
```

outputs the following Markdown:

```markdown
# Pork Tenderloin

## Ingredients
* 1 tenderloin
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* Salt
* Pepper
* Olive oil

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 400째F.
2. Pat tenderloin dry with a paper towel.
3. Cover tenderloin with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
4. Coat the bottom of an oven-safe pan with olive oil and put over medium-high heat until shimmering.
5. Sear the tenderloin, turning occasionally, for about 8 minutes or until well browned.
6. Remove pan from heat and place in oven for 20 minutes or until an internal temperature of 145째F is reached.
7. Remove from oven and loosely tent with foil, allowing to rest for at least 5 minutes before cutting and serving.
```

Not the most exciting conversion, but it works!

[^2]: Serde will likely be used for communication between Sous instances in
  this case.
